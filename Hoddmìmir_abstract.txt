The final model we chose is a Random Forest Regressor with 100 estimators and maximum depth equal
to 10. The best hyperparameters for this model, as for the ones from the other classes of models,
have been found through a 5-fold cross-validation on our internal training set (the original training 
set without the internal test set we obtained through partitioning). The choice of the unique
final model, between the 6 models we obtained, was performed through a 10-fold cross-validation.

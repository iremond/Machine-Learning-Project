Machine Learning university project
For two different tasks (classification and regression), we compared several models to identify the differences between them and choose the best one based on their performance.

In order to check out the Regression Task, run the "regression_ML-CUP" notebook 
In order to check out the Classification Task, run the three notebooks (Monk1, Monk2, Monk3)
